About the Project:

The main task in this project was to design our own CPU.


TeamWork:

We didn't spilit the project between ourselfs and we went through each section together. We disscused and talked about diffrent ideas to how to do the tasks needed. We spent most of our time on searching, learning and designing the things needed. And we couldn't implement many of them. But we have uploaded the documnets of our brainstorms meetings.
